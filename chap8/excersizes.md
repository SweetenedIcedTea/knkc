# Problem 1 - Why is sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]) better than sizeof(a) / sizeof(t), where t is the type of a's elements?

# Problem 2 - Describe how to use a digit(in character form) as a subscript. (Q&A shows how to use a letter as subscript)

# Problem 3 - Write a declaration of an array named weekend containing seven bool values. Initalizer makes first and last values true, all other values are false.

# Problem 4 - Repeat exercise 3, but this time use an designted initalizer. Make it as short as possible

# Problem 5 - Write a program that declares an array of size 40, and fill the array with first 40 Fibonacci numbers

# Problem 6 - Write a 2D array that contains the segments of all the seven segment numbers. 
```
 _    0
| |  5 1
 _    6
| |  4 2
 _    3
```
start off: `const int segments[10][7] = {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0}, ...}`

# Problem 7 - Shrink the initalizer for problem 6

# Problem 8 - Write declariation for 2d array named temperature_readings that stores on month of hourly temperature readings. (Assume 1 month = 30 days) The rows are days of month, colums should represetn hours of day.

# Problem 9 - Use array of excersize 8 and write a program that ocmputes the average temperature for a month (averaged overall days of the month and all hours of the day)

# Problem 10 - Write a declariation for a 8x8 char array named chess_board. Include and initalizer that puts the followling data into the array:
Put it here
# Problem 11 - Write a program fragment that declars an 8x8 char array neamed checker_board and then uses and loop to sotre the folowing data into the array
Put it here
